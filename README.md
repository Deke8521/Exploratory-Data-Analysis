# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
This report conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the ‘Survival from Malignant Melanoma’ dataset using ‘R’ software (R Core Team, 2023) to glean insights and inform further research in the field. It is believed that the thickness of the tumor, and whether it is ulcerated influences the survival chances of patients that have been diagnosed with melanoma (the Skin Cancer Foundation, 2020). The data was collected from a study carried out on patients that had their tumor removed by surgery at the Department of Plastic Surgery, University Hospital of Odense, Denmark during the period 1962 to 1977.
